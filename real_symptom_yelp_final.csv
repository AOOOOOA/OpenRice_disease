0,1.0,"Hmm.. I never write reviews on here, but I felt I had to with this place.

First of all, it was expensive for the quantity that they give you. If the food was actually good and they had the atmosphere to match it would've made more sense to me. That was not the case - the restaurant was basic and to be honest, pretty run down for a restaurant on King West I'd expected better. The staff was rude with answering any questions and when the food came the ingredients were old and tasted like MOLD. I didn't even finish it before the waitress took it away and didn't think twice to ask why I left it (most staff will ask if you enjoyed the food at a good quality place - not here!) 

I would never go back here or recommend it to anyone in the area AND I agree with the post about food poisoning I was sick for two days after eating here!!! YUCK, disgusting. :(",poison

Other than that when I ordered the food, the front service was very polite and nice.",poison

We called to have it fixed and they said they would fix it but they didn't.  After our 2nd call they said they'd take one night of hotel fees off our bill.  

The beds were comfortable, the couple I was staying with said they could hear our neighbors through the wall but I didn't.  The hotel is cute, the Flamingo garden is awesome.  The buffet was the worst I've had in Vegas (compared to Luxor and Excaliber.)  I wouldn't stay here again.",diarrhea

I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll, spicy yellowtail handroll, and a spicy tuna roll, all of which are my go-to items at a sushi restaurant.

I (used to) grab slices from here because I live close and it's cheap, but I found every second time I did, I got really Ill afterwords.  I can only speak for the veggie or cheese slices, but if THATS giving me food poisoning, I'd be really afraid of touching any meat product here. Something is wrong with the food in this place.  You're also surrounded by mirrors inside, and I often find myself looking into them asking myself what fuck I'm doing eating there again.",poison

So after seeing an excellent show we both decided to go to a drive thru to get food for dinner so it'll be faster and we can have it in our hotel. We agreed on going to Smashburger to try it out since we've never been to one. Although the cashier was very nice, I cannot say the same about the food that we got. 

With the price we paid for, we were given food that wasn't our order. We ordered Avocado Club Beef and Smashburger beef with salad and we both got Bacon Cheeseburger and salad. I'm surely don't think it was a mixed up because we were the only one waiting in the drive thru.

The worst part is that my boyfriend ended up getting food poisoning. Surely it came from what he ate from that place because some of it came out when he was throwing up early this morning.

And nobody in our party of 6 felt right after eating there....varying levels of food poisoning with the common denominator being the chicken bucket. The popcorn pot de creme was good but $8 for probably an ounce. Overall, very overpriced and the food is weird/induced stomach problems. This was my second time there and the first was not impressive either. Would not return.",poison
30,1.0,Horrible food. Everything that we ordered was blah. I can't believe that this place averages 4 stars. Yelp reviews just lost a whole lot of credibility. The best part of our meal was the fortune cookie. The spring rolls were mushy. The sushi didn't look or taste fresh. The noodles in the chicken lo mein were decent but the chicken tasted sour. The chicken teriyaki was bland and the recipe needs an overhaul. We all felt ill after the meal.  About 5 hours after the meal the person in our party that ate the chicken teriyaki threw up - classic food poisoning. Never again.,poison
31,1.0,"I would give it zero star if I could because of food safety reason. My husband and I went here for brunch. He ordered a grilled pork banh mi stuffed with some suspiciously bright-colored meat, pickled veggies, and raw cilantro. I got a breakfast sandwich with cooked eggs, ham, and cheese on croissant. Later that day, my husband started to feel sick - lack of appetite, light headed, and slight diarrhea. The diarrhea was getting much worse that night and the symptoms lasted for 2 days after we put him on anti-diarrhea medicines. We believe it was due to food poisoning from the banh mi since we ate otherwise the same food that day. We had banh mi regularly in other places and we never had any issue. This place charged less for a reason. I feel grossly sick when I think about the who-knows-what meat like stuff and RAW veggies. Beware of the food safety issues here!",poison

We had the Tuna Chips, Calamari Fries, and the Black Vinegar Barbecue Ribs. I'm not sure which one it was, but since I'm the only one who got sick and only I ate the BBQ Ribs, while the rest of the table split the other two, I'm assuming it was that. I felt fine at first, but a couple hours later I found myself throwing up.

35,1.0,If I could select no stars I would. This place is dirty all over and you could see if from the drive-thru window. They only have 1-2 people working and the drive-thru super full. I've been to this Sonic location many times and I've never had a problem until recently. My husband got very sick from eating one of the hotdogs on their menu. He has been throwing up all day.. It is vary rare for him to get sick so this must be due to the cleanliness or maybe even wasn't made right due to the rush of the employees because there was only 2 workers. Won't be getting any food from this location ever again.,throwing up

The hot and sour soup was bland as well. After a crappy dinner my son woke up the next day vomiting all over the place and I started shortly after. We spent a good 48 hours puking everything we ingested up (which is not what you want to doing while 20 weeks pregnant).

After singing happy birthday half heartily, the waiter kept saying he will charge us for leftovers and how much for each leftover. Honestly, we didn't even order that much but their some rolls were so sweet and drenched with sauce, it was a bit gross. And chicken fried rice so so. How are we supposed to know if we don't order what we know already if it'll taste good? I felt like we were obligated to eat bad or mediocre food that we ordered. This time, only half of our food was good. But food tasted really greasy on some flavors. Forgotten orders is common here. Oh, I also got bad diarrhea afterwards. A worst birthday dinner ever.

What I especially didn't like was styrofoam cups for water, and no refills; and flimsy plastic forks and plates. And the soup is not served in a bowl, it came in a plastic container and we were given two Styrofoam bowls and had to pour the soup into them. Since the soup was scalding hot husband had to use several paper napkins wrapped around the container to keep from burning his hand!

When the food finally arrived, two of our three orders were wrong.  Food was unexceptional and very dry.  No free chips and salsa like every other Mexican restaurant on the planet.
I was awoken at 4 am that night in the hotel to the sound of my 18-year old throwing up the Chicken Burrito he had eaten that night at La Taquito and my wife trying to clean it up off the bathroom floor.

I don't know if it was bad tuna or bad mayonaise and hope no one else got sick. I hope the manager checks into it so that they don't repeat. I am afraid now to buy from them agian.

I can't complain about the service.  The food was standard Olive Garden fare, although the zuppa toscana seemed watered down.  My lasagna wasn't bad going down, although not so much coming back up.  If I hadn't gone through hours of abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, I probably wouldn't complain.  It was too expensive, but that wasn't unexpected.

Aside from the weird vibe the food was truly not good. The seasonal salad contained figs that were not ripe and hardly a blue cheese chunk to be found. The salad was heavy on the prosciutto but so heavy it felt greasy. Sadly the salad was still the best part of the dinner. The oysters were pricey ($17 for 6) and definitely not my favorite. I did not finish them (thankfully but I will get to that later). I had my suspicions so I opted for something that seemed difficult to mess up for my entree. Wrong. I had the Mac nut crusted mahi. It was so over cooked it chewed like chicken. The vegetables were tough and the asparagus looked old. Let's just say after spending over $200 on dinner we weren't happy. Icing on the cake was two hours later I began vomiting from food poisoning. Still in bed as I write this review.!,poison
78,1.0,"This was our second visit to Mallorca and our last! 
We both had food poisoning from this dinner. Projectile vomiting for hours. Horrible, more horrible than I thought possible. It took us 2 days to feel normal again.
Aside from that being one of the worst feelings I've ever experienced and never wanting to even look at that place again, here is the rest of my review if you care to read. 
Don't bother asking them questions about the wine list! 2 different people came to our table to try to help and neither had a clue about any of the wines. We ended up picking randomly. I will admit, the food is pretty tasty on the way down. Can't say the same on the way up. We had veal osso bucco and the grouper seafood special, then peach and mango sorbet for dessert. You can tell the waitstaff is trying but they need more wine education and  they tried to take away our plates about every 2 minutes while we were still eating. That's all. 
Hey Mallorca-clean your kitchen.",poison

80,2.0,"My mistake for ordering a dozen oysters in Wisconsin.  I got the #2 tower and the shrimp were the best part.  The crab legs were not very succulent and almost seemed like they had been frozen for too long; the meat was a little mushy.  The oysters seemed OK going down, but I had terrible food poisoning later that night as my body rid itself of all of them.

I love seafood so I will probably try it again, but next time I'll stay away from the oysters.

Two stars because it has a great atmosphere.",poison
81,2.0,Would have given the place a better review an all around good eating establishment. I ordered the chicken Parmesan and it was a solid dish. The down side is my friend ordered the terminator and to make a long story short he didn't fee well after. He ended up getting food poisoning. So if you want to take the risk of going there and getting food poisoning be my guest but I know I won't be dining out there for a long time to come,poison
82,1.0,"A terrible lunch that ended in physical pain. 

Wait time for lunch - A   no wait
Waitress - B - smiled, friendly, good drink refills, the problem is that she brought me the food.... see below.
Food - F - as others noted, cold and wrong, literally made me sick within an hour - 

boneless wings with cheese fries. The fries had so little cheese sprinkled on them, and the wrong kind of cheese, that we sent them back. Second time around they didnt have much more cheese than before. Wings did not taste very good. I only ate half.

The unforgivable sin is that I am now spending my afternoon running to the boys room due to mild food poisoning. I will not be returning.",poison
83,1.0,"I went with a group on saturday night, and most of us had a travelzoo voucher.  Our server was friendly, and service was quick and attentive.  We shared three appetizers - the meat and cheese plate, salmon carpaccio, and guacamole and chips.  They were nice for starters and not too large.

We each got a salad, mine was average - butter lettuce with a viniagrette, good but not great.  

For dinner I had the salmon, most people got steaks - all were tasty.  The meats were cooked to a good temp, the salmon was moist.  

One unfortunate person in our party got the chicken and shrimp.  He wasn't unfortunate in that it tasted bad, I think it was good.  He was unfortunate in that he got a bad case of food poisoning - vomiting and bloody stools.  And that's the reason I had to give the place a 1 - I wouldn't go back or recommend it to anyone because of that.",poison
84,1.0,Beautiful modern hotel but extremely sad when I got food poisoning from the restaurant downstairs on our Anniversary weekend and the hotel did not compensate us back in anyway nor give us a call back when we were over charged.

85,2.0,Its not about what happens but how you handle it. Yesterday I was having a long day and I decided to stop by Millers Ale house for dinner because they were open late. I was greeted by the bartender Summer and the manager Ryan stopped by to check in with me because she was busy. I ordered the Southwest Bistro Steak salad. It tasted amazing. So much so that I ordered a carry out of the same thing. Towards the end I noticed a hair in my food... EEEWWW butttt this could have happened anywhere. The manager Ryan was very apologetic and took care of my bill. He ensured me that this does not happen often and was very empathic towards the situation which was nice. Despite the hair I would have still given them a 3.5 star for the customer service and cleanliness but the night got worse. Once I got home I immediately felt sick and realized I had a case of food poisoning. I'm sad to have to give a bad review because the food was very tasty and the staff was nice but today I am still feeling ill.,poison
86,1.0,"My best friend and I were doing a lot of running around and needed to grab a quick lunch so we came here. We heard they were great for the meatballs and garlic bread. 

The garlic bread was in the shape of a knot and they where huge and very garlicky. They tasted really good but  a bit too much garlic. 

The meatballs honestly weren't the greatest and they where overly used with garlic!

The pizza was just a normal brick oven pizza nothing special at all. 

A little while latter man was I sick. I think it's way too much garlic used in the food. My friend and I were vomiting from the food. It was so bad.",vomit
87,3.0,"Actually we are fan of sashimi and sushi . So we came to i love sushi and expect to get really fresh fish and unique sushi . But over all on the menu most are sushi roll .so we try a hand roll , sashimi . Which is ok . And unagi don came with good portion but eel little too sweet and have some bone which is you have to careful litle bit while you eat . And yellow tail collar was very disappointment because the fish was old and taste not impression . ( made me got diarrhea later that night ) . For the service for out table i guess the waiter not really attentive . After he took an order he came back a couple time to asked again that what we order . We took not too long to finish our dinner before we leave we have one lady to seem like she attention but just right before we get a check .",diarrhea

89,1.0,"Definitely got food poisoning from this place! I had the basil-pesto shrimp, recommended by our waiter. I actually questioned the flavor of the meal a bit- but after a busy day, I was starving and it was the ONLY thing I'd eaten that day. I chalked it up to just being something I'd never had before. I was violently ill (I'll spare you the details) from 2am that morning until about 7pm that night. Couldn't so much as even take a sip of water. Since I couldn't exactly make a phone call the next day from being so sick- my husband sent an email to the manager. No response. Great business ethics! Not! Even if you DON'T think I could have possibly gotten sick from your food don't you call to ask some clarifying questions to be sure?",poison

92,1.0,"FOOD POISONING! I can't remember the last time I was throwing up so much and dealing with stomachaches and cold sweats. We ordered a few orders of sake nigiri and it smelled stale and not refrigerated. The service was great, but I'm in so much pain right now that I don't think I would go back again. Plenty of people recommended this place to me, but reading other reviews, it looks like I'm not the only one who got really sick. I would never recommend a restaurant where the chefs consistently get their guests sick.",throwing up
93,1.0,"We got an order of Hot Garlic and an order of Hot & Sweet.  The wings were very skinny, fatty, greasy, and to make it worse, they didn't put enough sauce so I ended up adding some Kraft BBQ sauce I had at home.  

The fries were pretty mushy, greasy, and tasteless.  

And to finish it off, both of us got food poisoning!!   I noticed that when they were serving them, a couple of wings fell on the kitchen counter and they just put it right in my box.  When I saw that I was crossing my fingers that the kitchen counter would have been as clean as their mixing bowls, but maybe that was not the case.  

DEFINETLY NOT COMING BACK.",poison

95,2.0,"Sakana sushi was mediocre for an AYCE sushi restaurant until my husband had the oysters. He was the only one who ate them and right after dinner, he felt sick to his stomach. The next morning he felt even worse and I'm thinking he had food poisoning from those oysters because he hadn't eaten much else all day knowing that we were going to an AYCE sushi restaurant for dinner. 

The only things that were decent were the garlic tuna nigiri and the skewers with bacon wrapped asparagus and lobster. The yuzu hamachi was also pretty good. The pricing for the AYCE menu is $25.95 for dinner, which I think is good if you can eat tons of sushi but definitely not the best quality. 

Service was terrible. Our waitress (girl with black framed glasses) was not friendly and gave us our check while we were still eating as if she was trying to rush us out. She acted as if she was irritated to take our order each time she came to the table. We ordered hot tea (which we had to pay for) and it never came even with asking for it twice. 

This was my first time here and I was very excited to try it out after reading all the great reviews but I won't be returning.",poison
96,1.0,"I swore to myself that I would write a scathing review of this place one day. That day is today.

I visited this Starbucks during Memorial Day weekend in 2008. I was vegan at the time and got an iced soy latte. Within about 3 hours of consuming my drink, I began to feel sick. I'll spare you the details, but will say that I suffered the worst bout of food poisoning known to man.  (Anyone who's suffered food poisoning will argue that their experience was the worst, right?)  I hear tell that bad soy milk can cause horrible food poisoning, so I'm certain that was the source of my misery. Not only did I quit drinking coffee after that ordeal, but I also gave up being vegan. I couldn't imagine ever touching soy milk again. 

I realize these things happen and it doesn't mean that all Starbucks are terrible and to be avoided...just think twice, perhaps, when ordering a drink with soy.",poison

We've been ordering and going here for over a year. We know what we get when we go here, terrible service, passable sushi, good prices. You get what you pay for and we bite the bullet when go. We know exactly what to expect.

One thing we never expected was to get food poisoning. My wife and I were sick for almost a whole week. I won't be going back and we'll probably head up the street and pay a bit more money at another place to get safer food with better service.",poison

The service was terrible after we ordered 5 rolls and only received 4....I asked the waiter to check on it, the pop rockin roll that was apparently their featured roll, and what do ya know he never brought it anyways. And I think we were still charged for it too!!! $270 down the drain for sushi that is $25 for FIVE FUCKING pieces. Nothing had flavor and all of us left hungry still and have to go eat somewhere else because we were so sick of this place. I am furious and woke up to a stomach full of food poisoning. If you want to eat here just catch $270 on fire and it will be just as satisfying at sitting down and eating in this disgusting bad serviced place.",poison

That's all it took to incapacitate me for the next 36 hours, thankfully my girlfriend's was more fully cooked and didn't get it as bad. I don't know if it was because we arrived on a Sunday at 10pm or if they use leftover steaks for groupon users but it is inexcusable. I've never been so sick and based on the symptoms, I think it might have been salmonella. The only saving grace was the talented karaoke singers. I usually never post reviews but felt it was necessary to warn people of the gamble of eating here. I realize not everyone gets food poisoning here but even one time is too many.",poison

Stay at motel 6........it would be an upgrade !!!!  Managers take no responsibility for my wife's illness so far, Just kick the can down the road. Oh and the 30 bucks to check in early...WTH...... if the rooms open give the customer the key. Just another way to rip you off.",poison
